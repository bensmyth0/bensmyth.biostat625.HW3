## Introduction

This document will outline the usage of the command `linear()` that is introduced in this package. 

`linear()` takes a total of three arguments: `y`, `x`, and `data`.

* `y`: The name of the response variable from `data`. If `data = NULL`, then it is instead taken to be the vector of the response variable.

* `x`: A vector including the names of the explanatory variables to use in the linear model fit. If `data = NULL`, then it is instead taken to be a matrix of the explanatory variables, with each column containing a different variable.

* `data`: Specifies the dataset from which `x` and `y` should be taken from. Defaults to `NULL`.
